# eks-gitops-apps

GitOps repository for the Kubernetes application layer running on the EKS cluster.

This repository is the declarative source of truth for in-cluster applications and supporting resources managed by ArgoCD after the infrastructure bootstrap is complete.

---

## Overview

This repository manages the Kubernetes layer after `eks-infrastructure` has:

- provisioned the EKS cluster
- installed ArgoCD
- created the root ArgoCD application

From that point onward, ArgoCD continuously reconciles the content of this repository to the cluster.

---

## What This Repository Owns

This repository owns the **application and platform layer inside Kubernetes**, including:

- AWS Load Balancer Controller application
- sample application
- flask application
- monitoring chart deployment
- monitoring resources layered on top of the monitoring stack
- Telegram alert webhook application

This repository is intentionally separate from the Terraform repository so infrastructure provisioning and Kubernetes desired state remain cleanly separated.

## GitOps Model

The root application created from eks-infrastructure points ArgoCD to apps/.

ArgoCD then reconciles the application layer by reading apps/kustomization.yaml, which aggregates:

  * aws-load-balancer-controller/app.yaml
  * sample-app/app.yaml
  * flask-app/app.yaml
  * monitoring-chart/app.yaml
  * monitoring-resources/app.yaml
  * telegram-alerts/app.yaml

This means changes are applied through Git commits, not by manually patching the cluster.

Workflow:

  1. Change manifests in Git
  2. Push to repository
  3. ArgoCD detects drift
  4. ArgoCD syncs the cluster to the desired state

This keeps deployments declarative, traceable, and auditable.

---

## Application Layout

### 1. AWS Load Balancer Controller

apps/aws-load-balancer-controller/

This application is deployed through ArgoCD from the external AWS EKS Helm charts repository and uses local values for:

  * cluster name
  * service account
  * IRSA role annotation
  * region
  * VPC ID

---

### 2. Sample App

apps/sample-app/

A demo workload used as a simple application target, with:

  *	namespace manifest
  *	deployment
  *	service
  *	ingress
  *	HPA

This gives a separate example application distinct from the Flask application.

---

### 3. Flask App

apps/flask-app/

The Flask application is deployed from manifests stored in this repository. The directory includes:

  *	deployment
  *	service for user traffic
  *	separate metrics service
  *	ingress
  *	ArgoCD application definition

This separation allows user HTTP traffic and Prometheus metrics scraping to be handled independently.

---

### 4. Monitoring Chart

apps/monitoring-chart/

This application installs the monitoring stack using the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart through ArgoCD.

The chart values are stored locally in:

  * apps/monitoring-chart/values.yaml

This is the base monitoring platform layer.

---

### 5. Monitoring Resources

apps/monitoring-resources/

This directory contains monitoring objects that sit on top of the monitoring chart, such as:

  *	PrometheusRule
  *	AlertmanagerConfig
  *	ServiceMonitor
  *	dashboards

This split is intentional:

  *	monitoring-chart installs the platform
  *	monitoring-resources customizes what that platform monitors and how it alerts

---

### 6. Telegram Alerts

apps/telegram-alerts/

This application deploys the webhook service that receives Alertmanager webhooks and forwards them to Telegram.

It is managed as its own ArgoCD application and includes:

  *	deployment
  *	service
  *	secret
  *	local kustomization

This makes the alert delivery path explicit and independently deployable.

---

## Monitoring Architecture

The monitoring flow in this repository is:

Flask metrics endpoint
  -> ServiceMonitor
  -> Prometheus
  -> PrometheusRule
  -> Alertmanager
  -> telegram-alerts webhook
  -> Telegram

This design separates:

  *	platform installation
  *	monitoring configuration
  *	notification delivery

into clear GitOps-managed components.

---

## Why the Monitoring Split Matters

The repository uses two monitoring-related applications for a reason:

### monitoring-chart

Owns installation of the Prometheus / Alertmanager / Grafana stack itself.

### monitoring-resources

Owns project-specific monitoring objects such as:

  *	alert rules
  *	service discovery
  *	dashboards
  *	Alertmanager routing config

This keeps the Helm chart clean while preserving flexibility for project-specific observability resources.

---

## Deployment Flow

  1. eks-infrastructure creates the cluster and installs ArgoCD
  2. bootstrap/root-app.yaml points ArgoCD to this repository
  3. ArgoCD reads apps/kustomization.yaml
  4. Each application in apps/ is reconciled into the cluster
  5. Ongoing changes are delivered by commit + sync

---

## Operating Model

Make changes by editing Git manifests, then push.

Typical workflow:

git add .
git commit -m "update application manifests"
git push

ArgoCD will detect drift and reconcile the cluster to match this repository.

---

## Notes

  *	This repository should remain the single source of truth for in-cluster desired state
  *	Avoid manual kubectl edit changes unless debugging temporarily
  *	Permanent changes should always be committed back to Git

---

## Relationship to the infrastructure repository

This repository assumes the EKS cluster already exists.

Infrastructure provisioning is handled separately in:

```text
eks-infrastructure
```

In short:

  * eks-infrastructure provisions the cluster

  * eks-gitops-apps configures what runs inside the cluster
